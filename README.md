# Search_Script

A C# executable that takes in three parameters, <csv_file_path>, <column_index> and <search_key>, where <csv_file_path> is the path of the csv file, <column_index> is the column to search in and <search_key> is the key to search within the csv file.

After a successfull search, it returns the line which contains the search key.

To run the script, open CMD and open the directory in which the "Search.exe" exits, then paste this line within the CMD 
"Search.exe <csv_file_path> <column_index> <search_key>" exclusive of "" and <> with appropriate arguments.
